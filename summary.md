## 1. How to replicate

### Requirements

1. Python 2.7

2. Libraries
  * bs4
  * lxml
  * selenium
  * pandas
  * statsmodels

3. chromedriver.exe

  Downloadable [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).

4. Inquirim API token

  [Here](https://www.inquirim.com/account/api/) to create one. Used to retrieve macro data for the VAR computations.

### Project configuration

```
git clone https://github.com/OriolAndres/news_risk
```

create settings.py file in top directory ("news_risk/settings.py") and define the following lines:

```python
import os
token = '<inquirim_api_token>' ## https://www.inquirim.com/account/api/ 
chromedriver = r"<path_to_chromedriver>\chromedriver.exe" 
download_dir = r'<default_download_directory_chrome/firefox>'
rootdir = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))
```

#### Download El Pais files and find keywords: 
```python
from news_risk.elpais import start_from_scratch
start_from_scratch() # downloads full economy archive from El Pais (1976-2016), matches articles against conditions
```

#### Get company Q2 / annual reports from CNMV
```python
from news_risk.accounts import fetch_folder, fetch_list_by_sector, unzip, parse_xml
fetch_folder() # selenium (firefox) iterates over all companies to get all their reports
unzip() # zip to plain text
parse_xml() # extract company name, sales and salary expenses
fetch_list_by_sector() # list companies in each sector
```

#### Intermediate step

Write regular expressions for each company to use to match companies extracted from BOE. Patterns in accounts/biz_meta_regex.csv.

#### Get BOE
```python
from news_risk.boe import download_boe, catch_entities
download_boe() # get awarded public works per year
catch_contractor_money() # extract who are awarded and how much they are paid
```

#### Get stocks from Invertia.com
```python
from news_risk.stocks import fetch_folder
fetch_folder() ## selenium (chrome) to fetch stock price data for all components of Mercado Continuo
```

#### Run

### Abstract

In this project we estimate a political uncertainty index for Spain.
